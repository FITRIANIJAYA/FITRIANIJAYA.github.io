Hi, I'm Fitriani Jaya. I am currently studying Information Systems with a specialization in Management Information Systems, combining technical skills and creative thinking to build digital products.

Main interests:
- UI/UX: designing intuitive interfaces and meaningful user experiences.
- Web & App Development: building responsive websites and functional mobile applications.
- Art & Design: visual aesthetics and illustration play a key role in my design process.

Skills & tools:
- UI/UX design: user research, wireframing, and prototyping (Figma / sketches).
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, and experience with modern frameworks.
- Mobile: app concepts (Flutter / React Native depending on the project).
- Testing & QA: test case creation, manual testing, and API testing (Postman).
- Collaboration & versioning: Git, technical documentation, and cross-team communication.

Work approach:
- Human-centered design: start from user needs and iterate with testing.
- Balance aesthetics and functionality: designs that are both appealing and usable.
- Continuous learning: adopt new tools and methods to improve product quality.

Projects & portfolio:
- Academic and personal projects including UI mockups, responsive websites, and testing documentation.
- Case studies and code repositories are available on my GitHub profile.
